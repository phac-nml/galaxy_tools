********************
  What does it do?
********************
Using the output of SPAdes (a fasta and a stats file, either from contigs or scaffolds), it filters the fasta files, discarding all sequences that are under a given length or under a calculated coverage. Repeated contigs are detected based on coverage.

**********
  Output
**********

 - **Filtered sequences (with repeats)** 
 - Will contain the filtered contigs/scaffolds including the repeats. These are the sequences that passed the length and minumum coverage cutoffs.
 - For workflows, this output is named **output_with_repeats**
 - **Filtered sequences (no repeats)**   
 -  Will contain the filtered contigs/scaffolds excluding the repeats. These are the sequences that passed the length, minimum coverage and repeat cutoffs.
 - For workflows, this output is named **output_without_repeats**
 - **Repeat sequences**                  
 - Will contain the repeated contigs/scaffolds only. These are the sequences that were exluded for having high coverage (determined by the repeat cutoff).
 - For workflows, this output is named **repeat_sequences_only**
 - **Discarded sequences**               
 - If selected, will contain the discarded sequences. These are the sequences that fell below the length and minumum coverage cutoffs, and got discarded.
 - For workflows, this output is named **discarded_sequences**
 - **Results summary**  : If selected, will contain a summary of all the results.

+------------+------------+------------+
|#name       |length      |coverage    |
+============+============+============+
|NODE_1      |2500        |15.5        |

+------------+------------+------------+
|NODE_6      |450         |25.2        |
+------------+------------+------------+

User Inputs:
------------

- Coverage cut-off ratio = 0.33 
- Repeat cut-off ratio = 1.75  
- Length cut-off = 500
- Length for average coverage calculation = 1000

Calculations:
-------------

**Average coverage will be calculatd based on contigs with length >= 1000bp**


- Average coverage = 15.5 + 50.0 + 2.3 + 14.3 / 4 = 20.5

**Contigs that have coverage in the lower 1/3 of the average coverage will be eliminated.**

- Coverage cut-off = 20.5 * 0.33 = 6.8

**Contigs with high coverage (larger than 1.75 times the average coverage) are considered to be repeated contigs.**

- Repeat cut-off = 20.5 * 1.75 = 35.9

**Number of copies are calculated by dividing the sequence coverage by the average coverage.**

- Number of repeats for NODE_3  = 50 / 20.5 = 2 copies


Output (in fasta format):
--------------------------

**Filtered sequences (with repeats)**

::

>NODE_1
>NODE_3 (2 copies)
>NODE_5

**Filtered sequences (no repeats)**

::

>NODE_1
>NODE_5

**Repeat sequences**

::

>NODE_3 (2 copies)

**Discarded sequences**

::

>NODE_2
>NODE_4
>NODE_6
