# MOB-suite: Software tools for clustering, reconstruction and typing of plasmids from draft assemblies


These are Galaxy wrappers for [MOB-Suite](https://github.com/phac-nml/mob-suite): a set of tools designed to be a modular set of tools for the typing and reconstruction of plasmid sequences from WGS assemblies. This wrapper allows to conveniently run all these tools on a Galaxy instance. Also coupling MOB-Suite tools with other AMR tools via workflows allows to obtain both mobilome and resistome valuable information.
