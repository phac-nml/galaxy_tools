        What it does
        This tool provides a means for relabeling the tips of a newick formatted tree.

        It takes a newick format tree file to modify tip labels and a tab-delimited file containing current tip labels and additional information to add to the tips in 2 or more columns.

        Usage
        Header row of the tab delimited file must start with a '#'. An example is below:

        label outbreak year location
        orgs1 outbreak1 year1 location1
        orgs2 outbreak2 year2 location2
        and so on.

        The information in the tab file is inserted into the tree file so the new information will appear on the tip labels.

        Input
        Newick format tree

        Tab delimted file

        Desired delimiter for updated tip labels
